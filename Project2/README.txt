----------SSL INSTALLATION-------------
1. brew update
2. brew install openssl
3. cd /usr/local/include
4. ln -s ../opt/openssl/include/openssl
5. #include <openssl/sha.h>
6. compile like "gcc Client.c -lssl -lcrypto"
7. COMPILER ==== HAPPY


Use the command 'make all' to compile the programs
Note: need to ignore the compile-time warnings, these are generated by the steps I had to take to ensure that StringEncoder actually worked.

Once compiled run ./server then ./client


You may then type messages from the client to the server, the server screen will see the sent string, then the signature, then print signature ' then send the client whether or not
signature == signature'

Only up to 5 clients are supported
